## Task
1. Loading the dataset.
2. Summarizing the dataset.
3. Visualizing the dataset.
4. Evaluating some algorithms.
5. Making some predictions.

A must-see example of data science is the iris dataset. We will predict which class of iris plant a plant belongs to 
based on its characteristics

## Description
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It is often used as a benchmark 
for testing classification algorithms and exploring data visualization techniques. The dataset consists of measurements of various attributes of Iris flowers, along with their corresponding species.

### **Output should like:**
    
    DecisionTree: 0.927191 (0.043263)
    GaussianNB: 0.928858 (0.052113)
    KNeighbors: 0.937191 (0.056322)
    LogisticRegression: 0.920897 (0.043263)
    LinearDiscriminant: 0.923974 (0.040110)
    SVM: 0.973972 (0.032083)

## Installation
1. [ ] pandas to load the data
2. [ ] matplotlib to do the visualization
3. [ ] sklearn to do the prediction

```angular2html
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
For working with this project you should run the my_open_the_iris.ipynb file. So open it with Jupyter Notebook
